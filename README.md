# Play Balls

### Task 1
when the ball shrinks back to 100 - change its color from red to yellow - solution line 66

### Task 2
Create a Ball2 like Ball1 

# 2.3
When the ball reaches the size of 400, every click will shrink its
size.
When the ball size reaches 100, it again starts to grow So, with the clicks, ball size goes as follows:
100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 350, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 150, 200 ....


# Task 3
Start from creating a Ball3 below Ball2. Ball3 is a copy of Ball1.
Then make the following functional changes to Ball3:
Clicking the ball alternates the ball appearance:
• Text changes to “ON” with color Yellow
• Text changes to “OFF” and ball color changes to Gray

3.2 Make ON/OFF functional
Make the “ON”/”OFF” button (Ball3) affects the operation of Ball1 and Ball2. Hence, if its “ON” then
Ball1 and Ball2 operates as usual. However, in case its “OFF”, then Ball1 and Ball2 do not react to
clicks
